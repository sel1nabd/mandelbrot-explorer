# Mandelbrot Set Explorer

A simple and super elegant fractal viewer. Click to zoom, drag to move about.

## Getting started

The viewer now lives inside a lightweight Next.js app so we can drop in Vercel
Analytics. Run it locally with:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a production build and preview it with:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Deploying to Vercel (`vercel --prod`) automatically wires up the
`<Analytics />` component we mount from `@vercel/analytics/next`.

## What it does

- Click anywhere to zoom in
- Drag to pan around
- Fiddle with the iteration depth for more detail
- Six colour schemes to choose from
- Download whatever you find interesting

Built personally with vanilla JS.

## Notes

Higher iterations = slower rendering. Start around 150 and go from there.
The maths is straightforward: iterating z → z² + c until it escapes or hits the limit. Standard Mandelbrot stuff.
Colour schemes use smooth interpolation so you don't get those horrible banding artefacts.

That's about it really ❤️
